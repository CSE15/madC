rom sinthia apu:
Oaishi: Summary of skills is not a good idea.
 Mention the skills. 
Reorder the sections. 
Education should come first. 
Bsc: dont say 2020
. Say expected date of graduation: 2020.
 Colors are too dull.
 Make it a bit more catchy. 
Search for templates in google. 
Include a section on projects
 and publications(if any).

Overall: Your resume should reflect 
that you have worked on it 
with sincerity. It means a lot. 
A person who is serious with
 the tiny staffs, will do great 
with the big things, because he/she 
likes perfectionism- That should be the
 impression when the reviewer gets the CV.
